Connecting your local Git repository with a GitHub server is a key step for **collaboration and version control**. This guide will take you through the simple steps to link your local code with GitHub, using easy-to-understand language. Let‚Äôs get started! üöÄ

## Why Connect Git with GitHub? ü§î

* **Version Control**: Track changes in your codebase.
    
* **Collaboration**: Work with others seamlessly online. Very important features like fork and clone to get the copy of the repository with you, so that easy to contribute on any project.
    
* **Backup**: Keep your code safe on the cloud. Local system can crash and loose the data, whereas if it is hosted / stored online it will be safe.
    
* **Privacy:** You can optimise your repository, by making them Private or Public. Private repositories are restricted from outsiders who are not authorised, whereas Public repositories are open to all and creates a Collaborative Opensource platform.
    

### Key Difference between Git and GitHub

| S No | Git | GitHub |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Git is open source software maintained by Linux | Github is owned by Microsoft and having different pricing. |
| 2 | It is deistributed version control system to manage the version of the code locally. | GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides a collaborative environment for developers. |
| 3 | It is operated from local machine and commit changes locally | It has a global presence and server maintained, all the repositories are accesible online. |

**GitHub** is a platform built on top of Git that provides a collaborative environment for developers with additional features and tools. so both the tools are very much important and inter-related.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Connect Your Git Local with GitHub

### 1\. **Install Git**

First, ensure Git is installed on your system. Here‚Äôs how to check:

```plaintext
git --version
```

If you see a version number, Git is installed. If not, download and install it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).

### 2\. **Create a GitHub Account**

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up.
    
* Fill in your details and create your account. Very simple registrationüìù
    

### 3\. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**

* **Log in** to your GitHub account.
    
* Click on the **‚ÄúNew‚Äù** button under the Repositories tab.
    
* Name your repository, e.g., **‚ÄúMyFirstRepository‚Äù**.
    
* Choose the repository visibility (Public or Private).
    
* Click **‚ÄúCreate repository‚Äù**. üéâ

All the instructions to connect your local repository with remote repository will be provided as soon as you create new repository, shown below.

Below git commands need to be executed from local machine (VS Code, Git bash, etc).

Note: Here bydefault branch for Git local is "**master"** whereas in remote github it is "**main".** Hence as per the below instructions github is trying to make your local git branch as **"main"** from **"master"** before pushing to remote.

### 4\. **Initialize Your Local Repository**

Navigate to your project directory and initialize Git in VS Code. If you need to know how to connect VS Code with git, then go to [Tutorial](https://ganeshcmondal.hashnode.dev/how-to-start-with-git-using-visual-studio-code)

```plaintext
cd path/to/your/project
git init
```

### 5\. **Add Your GitHub Repository as a Remote**

Copy the repository URL from GitHub. It looks something like this:

```plaintext
Example:
https://github.com/<yourusername>/<MyFirstRepository>.git
```

Add this URL to your local repository, this command is provided after you create new repository in github.

```plaintext
git remote add origin https://github.com/<yourusername>/<MyFirstRepository>.git
```

### 6\. **Add Files to Your Repository**

Stage and commit your files:

```plaintext
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 7\. **Push Your Changes to GitHub**

Push your code to the GitHub repository:

```plaintext
git push -u origin main
```

You might be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. Use your GitHub credentials. üîê

Above authentication is a one time process to connect from local to remote git.

If you are using multiple git accounts, the you may need to flush the git origin and add new, however if you use another machine you need to do fresh configuration.

### 8\. **Verify the Connection**

Check the remote connection status:

```plaintext
git remote -v
```

You should see your repository URL listed. For example:

```plaintext
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/MyFirstRepo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/MyFirstRepo.git (push)
```

### 9\. **Making Changes and Pushing Updates**

* **Edit Your Code**: Make changes to your files.
    
* **Stage Changes**:
    
    ```plaintext
    git add .
    ```
    
* **Commit Changes**:
    
    ```plaintext
    git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
    ```
    
* **Push Changes to GitHub**:
    
    ```plaintext
    git push origin main
    ```
    

### 10\. **Creating a Branch (Optional)**

To work on new features without affecting the main code, create a new branch:

```plaintext
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
```

Push the branch to GitHub:

```plaintext
git push -u origin new-feature
```

## Troubleshooting Tips üöß

* **Authentication Issues**: Ensure you‚Äôre using the correct username and password. For enhanced security, consider using a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a password.
    
* **Merge Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts by editing the conflicted files and committing the changes.
    

## Conclusion üéØ

Connecting your local Git repository with GitHub is a straightforward process that opens up a world of collaboration and version control. With just a few commands, you can push your code to the cloud, making it easier to work with others and keep your code safe. üöÄ

Wonderful! You have successfully made connection between local Git and GitHub remote repository. Learn with simplicity.
